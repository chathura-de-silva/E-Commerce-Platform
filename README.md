  
You can entirely alter the initial database as per your requirements without involving in any coding(sql queries will be r0equired to specify the relations between tables and data types. But it is a simple process of modifying some text files.). For more info refer the later part of this document. 

Run the Project.
    *   This will initially create the database as you specified and will populate the data given. Thereafter it will run the app itself. If database already exists directly the app will run without reinitiating the database.
