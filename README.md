This repository contains the database design and implementation for a single vendor e-commerce platform for C, a local chain retailer in Texas with a simple UI. The platform supports the following features:

* Product management: The platform allows users to create, manage, and track products, including their variants, categories, and inventory.
* Order management: The platform allows users to place orders, track their orders, and manage their payments.
* Reporting: The platform provides a variety of reports to help administrators to track the performance of their e-commerce business.

# Implementation Details 
*   This project is using a SQL database to manage data. 
*   Backend is developed using Python with the `Flask` microframework.
*   This Project uses Server Side Rendering to render the user interface.
*   As per the requirements this project doesn't use an ORM anywhere and instead, always relies on vanilla SQL queries.
*   `Python version 3.11` or later recommended.
*   This project includes a python automation script which allows you to specify the initial database entirely by modifying some files without needing to write sql quries for everything.


## Getting started
*   As prerequisites you should have,
    *    your mysql environment set up  and server running.
    *    Python environment with `Python version 3.11` or higher.

To get started with the platform, follow these steps : 
1.  Clone this repository.
    ```plaintext
    https://github.com/chathura-de-silva/E-Commerce-Platform
    ```
2.  cd in to the project directory and Install the dependencies using following command.(Activate the Virutal Environment if you are using one. It's recommended to use one.)
    ```plaintext
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
<a name="env_setup"></a>

3.  create `.env` file inside the `dbInitialData` directory including following environmental variables.(You are supposed to update variable values according to your sql environment. You can simply copy the text below, modify it and save at the specified path as a `.env` file.)
    ```dotenv
    HOST=<hostname (defaults to "localhost")>
    USER=<MySql server username (defaults to "root")>
    PASSWORD=<your password (no defaults. You Must specify)>
    DATABASE=<Database name (deaults to "ecomdb")>
    ```
4.  You can entirely alter the initial database as per your requirements without involving in any coding (sql queries will be required only to specify the relations between tables and data types. Even it is a simple process of modifying some text files.). For more info refer the [later part](#configuration-of-initial-database) of this document.

5.  Run the Project.
    *   `app.py` is the main file.
    *   This will initially create the database as you specified and will populate the data given. Thereafter it will run the app itself. If database already exists directly the app will run without reinitiating the database.
# Configuration of Initial Database

## Overview
Everything you have to modify to create the initial database you wish to have is located inside `/dbInitialData/` directory.

* `database_relations.sql` holds 'ALTER' queries which creates the relations between tables of the database. 
* All the `.csv` files, each represents a table in the initial database.
* `.env` file (should be created by you as mentioned) contains environmental variables related to your MySQL environment.

## Tables
  Every `.csv` file will generate a separate table in the database.
  
  Table name will be the same as the csv file's name.
  * Ex - `product.csv` creates a table in the database called `product`. So you can create or rename the csv files as per your requirement.

  You can either use something like Microsoft Excel or a plain text editor like Notepad for the purpose of creation and editing of CSV files.
  
**Make sure to use double quotes(`"`) as the quotechar and comma(`,`) as the delimiter. Otherwise the project will fail to initiate the database properly.**
* If you are editing csvs' in Excel make sure that the delimiter and quotechar is set as specified. If you are using a text editor, you have to explicitly use the quotechar and delimiter wherever required. Using Excel is the preffered way.

### Column Identifiers
In each coloumn name, only the first word should be the column identifier. There after you have to specify the Data type starting from the next word. 

**Do Not enter anything other than the "\<column_identifier\> \<data type\>".**

### Data Entries
Fill the CSV file with records in the regular way. But data have to be in accordance with the data type of the respective column.
 
### Sample Table - product.csv

#### Table view
| product_id INT | title VARCHAR(255) | description TEXT          | weight DECIMAL(10, 2) | category_id INT | product_image TEXT |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| 101            | Samsung galaxy S21 | Samsung Galaxy S21, 128GB |0.35                   | 3               | /assets/s21u.jpeg  |
| 202            | Dennim Jeans       | Classic denim jeans       |0.6                    | 6               | /assets/jean.jpeg  | 
#### Text View
```csv
product_id INT,title VARCHAR(255),description TEXT,"weight DECIMAL(10,2)",category_id INT,product_image TEXT
101,Samsung galaxy S21,"Samsung Galaxy S21, 128GB",0.35,3,/assets/s21u.jpeg
202,Dennim Jeans,Classic denim jeans,0.6,6,/assets/jean.jpeg
```

## Table relations
You have to write `ALTER` SQL queries for the referencing inside `dbInitialData/database_relations.sql`.

Keep an empty line between each SQL query. 
You can add comments if you want to. But it is recommended to avoid comments.

Ex -     
  ```sql
    ALTER TABLE product
    ADD CONSTRAINT pk_product_id
    PRIMARY KEY (product_id);

    ALTER TABLE variant
    ADD CONSTRAINT pk_variant_id
    PRIMARY KEY (variant_id);
  ```
## Configuration of `.env` file.
